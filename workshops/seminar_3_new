# Семинар 3. Визуализация 3D структур в Chimera.

## План семинара
- An introduction to using Chimera to vizualize and manipulate 3D PDB structures
- Chimera user interface orientation
- Download and open PDB structure
- Rotating, translating, setting clipping planes, projection type, centering (actions) etc.
- Moving structure (actions)
- Making selections (by chains, residues, sequence, etc.)
- Structure visualization modes (atoms, ribbon, surface)
- Combining structures
- Structure and sequence alignment
- Building and changing structures (angles, bonds, rotamers)

- Chimera selection language             !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
- Scripting !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!


## Required software and resources
- Chimera
- 3-button mouse

## Learning resources
- [Chimera User's Guide] (https://www.cgl.ucsf.edu/chimera/current/docs/UsersGuide/)

## Assignments

A set of PDB structures of a macromolecular complex in different conformations will be suggested for analysis. The assignment report should include section detailing the following:

1. Visualize a molecule with labeled and differently colored positive, negative or aromatic amino acids and semitransparent surface.
2. Identify any clashes and fix them rotating amino acids angles.
3. Make structure and sequence alignment of chosen molecule with any of its homologs, color homologous domains.
4. Choose any segment of sequence alignment and make it fully matching  !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
5. Conservation analysis  !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
6. Describe any problems encountered

*. Make script for the task 1 with rotating the molecule in the end. !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

внести замены остатков (rotamers), чтобы максимально соответствовать гомологу (можно одну цепь/участок), выравнивания до и после



### Suggested problem sets
Each student should take a unique problem.
1. Make analysis of heaemoglobin and Oxy-deoxy transition (see [https://pdb101.rcsb.org/motm/41](https://pdb101.rcsb.org/motm/41))
2. Make analysis of opening and closing of potassium ion channels (see [https://pdb101.rcsb.org/motm/41](https://pdb101.rcsb.org/motm/41))
3. Analyze nucleosomal DNA unwrapping (1KX5 - wrapped nucleosome, 6ESH - unwrapped)
4. Make analysis of Spike-protein (see [https://pdb101.rcsb.org/motm/246](https://pdb101.rcsb.org/motm/246))
5. Any molecule of the month that has more than one conformational state ([https://pdb101.rcsb.org/motm/motm-by-date](https://pdb101.rcsb.org/motm/motm-by-date))

### Troubleshooting
- Consult with the seminar protocol/recording
- Try to Google, and see Chimera User's Guide
